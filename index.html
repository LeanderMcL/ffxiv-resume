        <h2>Work Experience</h2>
        <h3>Saviour of the Planet</h3>
        <p>Restored hope to the planet, including all remaining shards, by investigating and resolving the cause of the original Final Days. To achieve this goal I needed to employ the wide-ranging skills of a diverse team of people, apply strategic violence, and travel in time. All outstanding threats to the wellbeing of the planet and its people have now been defeated, leaving me open to new opportunities for self-development.</p>

        <h3>Warrior of Darkness</h3>
        <p>Saved the First, a shard which had been almost destroyed by an overabundance of Light-aspected aether. This required me to reconnect with old allies, learn how to travel easily between shards, adapt quickly to a new environment. I also needed to walk the fine line between treating my enemies with kindness and compassion, while also putting an end to their destructive schemes. I was able to control my own Light-aspected aether long enough to avoid completing the destruction of the world, as well as learning a great deal about the history of my own world, and where my most persistent enemies came from.</p>

        <h3>Liberator of Doma and Ala Mhigo</h3>
        <p>Helped restore independence to two separate nations, on different continents, both of which had spent decades under the yoke of the Garlean Empire. This required me to travel far and wide and forge a broad range of new alliances, as well as drawing on old ones.</p>

        <h3>Hero of the Dragonsong War</h3>
        <p>Ended a centuries-old conflict between the Elezen of Ishgard and the Dragons.</p>

        <h3>Warrior of Light</h3>
        <p>Ended the Seventh Umbral Era, averting another Calamity by defeating the Ascians who were behind it all.</p>
